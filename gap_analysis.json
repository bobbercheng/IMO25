    "CONTENT OVERFLOW: Model generated too much content (122 truncations). This suggests excessive exploration/reasoning without converging to a solution.",
    "EMPTY SOLUTIONS: Generated 52 empty solutions. This indicates failure to recover from errors or produce structured output after self-correction.",
    "VERIFICATION LOOP: Failed verification 112 times. This suggests inability to produce rigorous proofs or correct identified errors.",
    "MODEL CAPABILITY GAP: The failed model may lack efficient reasoning, structured output generation, or error recovery mechanisms present in the successful model.",
    "ITERATION INEFFICIENCY: Used 10 iterations but still failed, suggesting inefficient solution strategy."
